# ✅ Frontend-Backend Integration Complete

## 🎉 Integration Status: **SUCCESSFUL**

Your computer store management system is now fully integrated with both frontend and backend running seamlessly together!

## 🚀 What's Running

### Backend Server (Port 5000)
- ✅ **Express.js API Server** - Running on http://localhost:5000
- ✅ **MongoDB Database** - Connected and seeded with sample data
- ✅ **API Endpoints** - All endpoints functional and responding
- ✅ **Sample Data** - 10 products and 50 sales transactions loaded

### Frontend Server (Port 5173)
- ✅ **React + Vite Development Server** - Running on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ **API Proxy** - Configured to forward `/api` requests to backend
- ✅ **StoreContext Integration** - Using real API data instead of mock data
- ✅ **Real-time Data** - Frontend displays live data from MongoDB

## 🔗 Integration Points Verified

### ✅ API Connectivity
- Health check: `GET /api/v1/health` - ✅ Working
- Products API: `GET /api/v1/products` - ✅ Working (10 products loaded)
- Dashboard API: `GET /api/v1/dashboard/overview` - ✅ Working (live analytics)
- Sales API: `GET /api/v1/sales` - ✅ Working (50 transactions loaded)

### ✅ Data Flow
- **Frontend → Backend**: API requests properly proxied through Vite
- **Backend → Database**: MongoDB queries executing successfully
- **Database → Frontend**: Real data flowing to React components
- **State Management**: StoreContext using live API data

## 🌐 Access Your Application
